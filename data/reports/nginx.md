# Summary

- **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Enhancements:** Across multiple releases, improvements in HTTP/2 and the introduction of HTTP/3 have consistently provided substantial performance gains. These protocols reduce latency and improve connection handling, benefiting both ARM and x86 architectures.
- **TLS 1.3 Support:** TLS 1.3 handshakes are faster and more efficient, providing security and performance benefits. This has been particularly impactful on x86 systems due to their widespread use in server environments.
- **Dynamic Module Support:** Allowing modules to be loaded dynamically has improved flexibility and performance, as unnecessary modules are not loaded, optimizing resource usage on both ARM and x86 systems.
