## Quick notes

- openssl 1.1.1 is one of the more performant versions
- If not using certain functionality boringssl can give better performance
- modern CPU architectures have more SIMD (single instruction multiple data) execution units and can often execute the cryptographic parts of networking much faster
- Releases 1.1.1 and 3.1 provided substantial performance improvements through architectural changes and optimized cryptographic operations.
