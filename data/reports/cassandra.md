# Summary
- **ARM Optimizations**: Cassandra has made strides in optimizing performance on ARM processors, especially with the increasing adoption of ARM in data centers. These include better use of ARM's parallel processing capabilities and efficient memory usage.
- **x86 Optimizations**: Continuous enhancements leveraging x86 architecture strengths, such as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimizations for faster data processing and better cache utilization.

## Timeline

### Cassandra 4.0 (July 2021)
- **Performance Improvements**: Significant optimizations for latency and throughput. ARM and x86 architectures benefit from improved garbage collection, better resource isolation, and faster compaction processes.
- **New Features**: 
  - Virtual Tables: Allow for internal metadata to be queried via CQL.
  - Full Query Logging: Provides detailed logs for query debugging.
  - Improved Audit Logging: More detailed and configurable logs for security and compliance.
- **Stability Enhancements**: Extensive testing and over 1,000 bug fixes for increased reliability.

### Cassandra 4.1 (May 2024)
- **Performance Enhancements**: Continued optimizations from 4.0, with specific enhancements in read/write path efficiency, improving performance on both ARM and x86.
- **New Features**:
  - Guardrails Framework: Helps enforce best practices and operational limits.
  - Enhanced Repair Mechanisms: Improve consistency and reduce the operational burden.
  - Kubernetes Integration: Improved support and performance when running Cassandra on Kubernetes.

### Cassandra 3.11
- **Performance Enhancements**: Improved read and write speeds, better memory management, and reduced latencies. Enhancements apply to both ARM and x86 platforms, especially in concurrent read/write scenarios.
- **New Features**:
  - Improved streaming: More efficient data streaming for faster repairs and node operations.
  - Enhanced Compaction Strategies: Reduces the overhead of compaction operations.
- **Security Updates**: Enhanced TLS support and more robust encryption methods.

### Cassandra 3.0
- **Performance Improvements**: Better data distribution and consistency models, optimizing for both ARM and x86 architectures.
- **New Features**:
  - Materialized Views: Simplifies denormalization and data retrieval.
  - SASI (SSTable Attached Secondary Index): More powerful and efficient secondary indexing.
- **Stability and Bug Fixes**: Addressed critical bugs and improved overall system resilience.
