## Summary

- **String Functions:** Repeated optimizations to `memcpy`, `memcmp`, and `memmove` across multiple releases have significantly improved performance, especially on ARM and x86 architectures.
- **Memory Allocation:** Enhancements to memory allocation functions and synchronization primitives have provided substantial performance gains in multi-threaded and memory-intensive applications.
- **Dynamic Linker:** Continuous improvements in the dynamic linker have reduced load times for shared libraries, benefiting application startup times and overall performance.
